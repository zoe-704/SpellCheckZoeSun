| Sep 25 | 115-145pm | I implemented binary search to search through the dictionary and then return -1 if the word in the text is not in the dictionary. However, the code takes a long time to run for testSentence, so I need to see what went wrong and correct the code before next class.                                             |
| Sep 25 |  7-720pm  | I debugged the binary search code since my logic was wrong. I was doing low = mid-1 and high=mid+1 not high=mid-1 and low=mid+1 which was silly. I also corrected my return string by actually looking up how to convert from an ArrayList of strings to an array of strings. Binary search approach takes 3s 117ms |
