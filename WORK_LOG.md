| Sep 25 | 115-145pm | I implemented binary search to search through the dictionary and then return -1 if the word in the text is not in the dictionary. However, the code takes a long time to run for testSentence, so I need to see what went wrong and correct the code before next class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Sep 25 |  7-720pm  | I debugged the binary search code since my logic was wrong. I was doing low = mid-1 and high=mid+1 not high=mid-1 and low=mid+1 which was silly. I also corrected my return string by actually looking up how to convert from an ArrayList of strings to an array of strings. Binary search approach takes 3s 117ms                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Sep 25 |   6-7pm   | Remembered sets in c++ and learned that there are 3 types of sets in java (HashSet (unordered set), LinkedHashSet (ordered set), TreeSet). Used LinkedHashSet, not ArrayList to store misspelled words, so I don't need to see if the ArrayList contains a word. Then, I realized that I could use a HashSet to store the dictionary words for O(1) lookups. Check if the dictionary hashset contains the word, and if it doesn't, it is misspelled and should be added to the LinkedHashSet (ordered set). Runs significantly quicker, 997 ms. |
